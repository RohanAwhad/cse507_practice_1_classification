# Report on Model Training and Fine-tuning

## Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to compare the performance of training a model from scratch with fine-tuning a pretrained model. Specifically, we aim to evaluate a ConvNeXt model architecture on the CheXpert dataset. The evaluation involves running the model training processes independently ten times for both scenarios and reporting the performance in terms of AUC. We then compare these two approaches to assess the statistical significance of their performance differences by computing a p-value. Furthermore, this project extends to collaborating with peers for a comprehensive performance table across multiple datasets and architectures, and submitting results to challenge websites for formal evaluation and ranking.

## Dataset
The CheXpert dataset is a significant resource for advancing automated chest X-ray interpretation models. It consists of 224,316 chest radiographs from 65,240 patients, with data collected from Stanford Health Care. The dataset provides both frontal and lateral views of X-rays and includes uncertainty labels and radiologist-labeled reference standard evaluation sets. The large scale of the dataset and its robust reference standards make it a valuable benchmark for comparing model performance against expert human interpretation, addressing a crucial gap in the development of chest radiograph interpretation models.

## Model
The ConvNeXt model architecture represents a modern evolution of convolutional neural networks, designed to rival Vision Transformers in both accuracy and scalability. Built entirely from standard ConvNet modules, ConvNeXt models incorporate innovations such as a patchify layer for efficient data processing and Layer Normalization instead of Batch Normalization to enhance performance. These models maintain the simplicity of traditional ConvNets while achieving remarkable accuracy on benchmarks like ImageNet. ConvNeXt models also outperform Swin Transformers on tasks like COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation, making them a powerful choice for a wide range of computer vision applications.

## Methodology
The model training and fine-tuning process is orchestrated using a structured and efficient framework implemented in PyTorch, accommodating both single-GPU and multi-GPU environments through Distributed Data Parallel (DDP). Here is a detailed breakdown of the methodology employed:

### 1. Setup and Configuration
- **Optimizer Configuration**: The model parameters are grouped based on their dimensions, and an AdamW optimizer is configured with appropriate weight decay. If the training is executed on a CUDA device, a fused optimizer is utilized for enhanced performance.
  
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: A cosine learning rate scheduler is employed, featuring a linear warmup phase, a plateau, and a cosine decay. This scheduling strategy helps in gradually ramping up the learning rate at the start, maintaining stability, and then decaying to ensure convergence.

### 2. Training Loop
- **Initialization**: The model is moved to the specified device (CPU, GPU, or distributed setup), and training can resume from a checkpoint if specified.

- **Distributed Data Parallelism**: The model is wrapped in PyTorch's `DistributedDataParallel` if running in a distributed setting. This allows the model to be trained across multiple GPUs efficiently.

- **Gradient Accumulation**: The total batch size is effectively managed by accumulating gradients over a specified number of micro-batches, allowing for larger effective batch sizes without exceeding memory limits.

- **Forward and Backward Pass**: In each step, input batches are passed through the model, and the loss is computed using binary cross-entropy with logits. Gradients are backpropagated for each micro-batch, and optimizer steps are performed after accumulating the gradients.

- **Learning Rate Adjustment**: The learning rate is dynamically adjusted at each step based on the cosine schedule, ensuring optimal learning.

- **Logging and Visualization**: Training progress, including loss and learning rate, is logged periodically. Additionally, model predictions on test images are visualized, providing insights into model performance during training.

### 3. Evaluation
- **Periodic Evaluation**: The model is evaluated periodically on the validation set, calculating metrics such as loss, accuracy, and AUC. This helps in monitoring the model's generalization capability throughout the training process.

- **AUC Calculation**: The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is computed for each class independently to assess the model's ability to rank predictions correctly across different pathologies.

This methodology provides a robust framework for training deep learning models, leveraging advanced techniques in optimizer configuration, learning rate scheduling, and distributed training to achieve efficient and effective model convergence.

## Experiments
